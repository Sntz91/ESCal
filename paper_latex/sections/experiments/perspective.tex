\subsection{Perspective}
Perspective influences our experimental results. The lower the camera and its 
pitch, the greater the distance imbalance among our 
validation points. Close validation points have high pixel densities, while 
distant validation points have low pixel densities. This imbalance increases 
the variance in errors. In this section, we have already examined how 
lower pixel densities can lead to higher errors.

Table \ref{tab:results_overall} shows that images with low 
perspectives (such as IMG\_06 or IMG\_08) have significantly 
higher errors than others. However, perspective is only one 
factor\textemdash collinearity and suboptimal reference point compositions 
also contribute to the errors. Nonetheless, perspective magnifies 
these effects and generally introduces more measurement errors.
